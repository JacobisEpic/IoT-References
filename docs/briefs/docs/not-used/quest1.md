# First team and quest

## Find your partners and get seated in the classroom.

We ask you to stick with the same table and position for the duration
of the class.


## Setup github to host your joint work
- One member creates a repo that is shared with other team members
- Populate your repo with a code base on which you will do edits
- Each member (including the owner) creates a new branch from the master, for editing on their own laptop
- Each member will edit locally, commit to their own branches, and ultimately submit pull requests to resolve back to the main (master) branch.
- Branching is not required and for the sake of ease, it is fine to work straight on the master branch.
