# Design Pattern â€“ Setting Real Time on ESP32

One way to obtain real time is to query a Network Time Protocol
server. This networking protocol lets you synchronize your ESP32 to
the same clock source over the internet (requires internet
connectivity). The are other ways to obtain real-time, such syncing
with GPS.

The
[example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/protocols/sntp)
from espressif in your esp-idf folder is very extensive on how to
obtain and use real time form the network using Simple-NTP
(SNTP). Worthy a mention is that SNTP is not as accurate as NTP but is
usually sufficient for embedded systems applications. You must also
configure WiFi on your ESP32 by running `idf.py menuconfig` and
provide your WiFi credentials
