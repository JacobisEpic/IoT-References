## About this interactive course textbook

This interactive course textbook was developed over multiple
iterations by Prof. Thomas Little and Dr. Emily Lam
begining in the summer of 2018 and continuously improved since then.
It represents original materials developed and authored to meet
the requirements of the syllabus defined for EC444 approved by the College
of Engineering in the spring of 2018.

The utility of the textbook is ephemeral, depending heavily on
technology and content of the moment. The code base and development
tools are constantly being updated, leading to broken examples and
frequent debugging. Similarly, the hardware and peripherals become
obsolete or are no longer supported. Each semester we try to mix up
our quests and integrate new devices to solve new and interesting
applications. The e-text will always be a work in progress.
