# EC 444 Smart and Connected Systems

Hands-on introductory course to cyber-physical and IoT
systems. Microcontrollers: integrated development environments (IDEs),
architectures, and I/O interfaces. Hardware interfacing of signals:
sensors, actuators, duty cycling, and AD/DA
conversions. Cyber-physical systems: design and specification,
real-time OS, programming, and control. IoT systems: smart phones,
wireless networks and (LANs and WPANs), IP gateways, mobile cloud
computing, security, and privacy.

## Prerequisites:
Introduction to Logic Design (EC311); Introduction to
Software Engineering (EC327). Programming in C.

The course is meant to be a hands-on, giving students the opportunity
to learn topics in cyberphysical and IoT systems, and then put those
concepts to practice by developing and debugging small scale connected
microcontroller systems. The course goals are to introduce students to
(1) embedded microcontrollers and I/O, (2) cyberphysical systems
concepts and real time software (3) modern wireless and connected
technology, and (4) hardware and software development, debugging, and
collaboration and management tools.
