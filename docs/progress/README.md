# Progress

This section is to sketch out what will happen in upcoming classes and
to capture what happened, notes, and any other things relevant to
where we are in the course. PPTs presented in class have been moved to here.

## Class 1 (Tues 9/3)

- [Introduction to Smart and Connected Systems (PPT)](/docs/progress/docs/1.CourseOverview2024-09-01.pdf)
- [Expectations (PPT)](/docs/progress/docs/2.Expectations2024-09-01.pdf)

I want to emphasize the importance of getting your workflow figured
out early. The intent is for you to create local directories on your
laptops that can be uploaded to your personal area on the 444 github
site for our review. That would be one-click-type uploads via
push. This is to allow you to focus on the content not on the file
transfer headaches.
