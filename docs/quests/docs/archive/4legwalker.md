# Four Legged Walker

In this quest you will create a basic walking system which walks at
regular intervals. The system will employ two servos (each kit has one
servo, but you can share among team members for the quest) to
implement a four legged walker. At programmed intervals the servo will
shake back and forth to make the walker move forward three steps and
stop. The system should keep track of elapsed time and continuously
report the time until the next walking in seconds. A function for
setting the time intervals should be included, either via console or
(preferably) via a button interface.

## Description 
Our micro is more than capable of realizing an electronic watch or
alarm clock function. It's probably more powerful than most wrist-worn
watches. In this quest you will wrangle the features of the ESP32 to
build a clock or timer function to control the actuation of a servo to
walk at regular intervals. You will also produce a digital output on
the alphanumeric display showing the time until the next walk (i.e.,
the legged walker sleeps). For legs, you may attach something
malleable to the servo, e.g., a copper wire, paper clip that's been
opened, or a similar material.

## Solution Requirements
- Must keep track of time (no time loss)
- Must report time every second
- Must use two servos 
- Nice but not required: ask us for a battery so the walker can walk without connecting to the laptop.  


## Assignment
1. Design and build your solution to meet criteria specified in the rubric
2. Demonstrate your work
3. Reporting as per quest reporting instructions
4. Investigative questions: (1) What approach can you use to make
setting the time interval dynamic (not hard coded)? Elaborate. (2)
What if the servos were attached to two different microcontrollers?
How could you make them actuate the walker forward? Elaborate.
