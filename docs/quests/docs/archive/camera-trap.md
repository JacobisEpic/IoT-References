# Camera Trap

A camera trap is a device that is typically used to record images or
video of animals in remote locations. To achieve its mission, it must
sit idle at low power, sensing the presence of an animal. Upon
detection, the camera is activated to record one or more images or
video that are stored locally.  In our scenario we will transmit them
wirelessly to somewhere else.

## Assignment
1. Design a way to detect an animal. You have ample sensors in the kit to use to detect things. Ultrasonic, Lidar, IR, etc.
2. Design a workflow for the imagery. It needs be saved locally, then sent by WiFi or BLE.
3. Design a way to receive the imagery on your server (RPi). This implies some kind of web host.
4. Build your system and demonstrate
5. Report as usual
