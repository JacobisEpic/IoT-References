# The Floor is Lava/Car on Table

In prior courses we ran the cars through the corridors of PHO but then
someone complained. Instead we will work with what we have: round
tables!

In this quest you will figure out how to drive the car on the table
without it falling off (into the lava below). The challenge is how to
detect the edge prior spinning a wheel over the edge. 

Use your skills with range sensirng and PID control to
enable your car to selfdrive and not leave the table. 

Alternative
- RPi setup over round table with webcam
- Remote control by looking at camera on web page
- Drive car without coming off table
- Self drive without falling


Strategies
- Establish successful driving without collisions using the motors and sensors
and the use of PID on some measured parameter
- Establish driving a connected route segment (between two waypoints)
- Establish how to link two route segments (make a turn at a waypoint)
- Establsih how to keep track of a set of route segments that comprise an overall trip
- Optimize


## Assignment
1. Design and build your car
2. Demonstrate on track
3. The usual reporting
