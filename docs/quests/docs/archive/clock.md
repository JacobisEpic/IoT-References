# Alarm Clock Quest

Our micro is more than capable of realizing an electronic watch or
alarm clock function. It's probably more powerful than most wrist-worn
smart watches.  In this quest you will wrangle the features of the ESP32 to build a simple alarm clock.

## Assignment
1. Design the functions of your alarm clock and how you
plan to deliver the current time, the alarm signal, and the user
control.
2. Agree on target performance as assessment criteria (e.g., reports
time every second). Be complete, but keep it simple and objective.
3. Build your solution and demonstrate
4. Write up a description of how you built your device. Include
concepts, modules, APIs, tools, etc.
5. Submit a < 90s video of your report. Everyone must be on the video. 
6. Bonus: connect to ntp.org to glean global time
