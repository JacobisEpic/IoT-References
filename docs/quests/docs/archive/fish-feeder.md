# Fish Feeder

In this quest you will create a system to feed fish at regular
intervals. The system will employ the servo in the kit. At programmed
intervals the servo will shake back and forth to release the fish food
from the canister. The system should keep track of elapsed time and
continuously report the time until the next feeding in hours and
minutes.

## Description 
Our micro is more than capable of realizing an
electronic watch or alarm clock function. It's probably more powerful
than most wrist-worn watches. In this quest you will wrangle the
features of the ESP32 to build a clock or timer function to control
the actuation of a servo to feed fish (or chephalopods in our example)
at regular intervals. You will also produce a digital output on the
alphanumeric display showing the time until the next feeding. 

## Solution Requirements
- Must keep track of time (no time loss)
- Must report time every second
- Must use a servo 
- Nice but not required: attach a plastic pill bottle onto the servo to demonstrate shaking food into a tank.


## Assignment
1. Design and build your solution to meet criteria specified in the rubric
2. Demonstrate your work
3. Reporting as per quest reporting instructions
4. Investigative question: What approach can you use to make setting the time interval dynamic (not hard coded)? Elaborate.
