# Retro Clock

In this quest you will create a retro clock using servos and
a digital display.  

## Description

Our micro is more than capable of realizing an electronic watch or
alarm clock function. It's probably more powerful than most wrist-worn
watches. In this quest you will wrangle the features of the ESP32 to
build a simple alarm clock with digital output on the alphanumeric
display. But we'll make it even more interesting by adding mechanical
clock hands to indicate passing time.
