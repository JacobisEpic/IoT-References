# Search and Rescue Rover

Search and rescue combines activities of (a) driving a vehicle, (b)
finding an object, and (c) navigation with intent, within some
constrained space.  As you develop your solution, keep in mind that
your solution will be used in the last competitive quest -- capture
the flag.

Your task is to enable the vehicle to find a beacon within the
constrained space. Slightly different from the previous challenge,
your method will seek out the beacon vs. needing to know the exact
coordinates. But finding and positions could use the same technique.

Assumptions:
- You will work within a closed room
- We need to agree on the beacon type. IR or BLE or WiFi
- You may employ multiple vehicles to find the beacon
- The search process should be structured; based on speed or completeness or some combination
