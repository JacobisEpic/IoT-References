# Smart Blinds

Smart blinds are electomechanical window blinds that are linked to wireless sensors that measure in-room lighting. Goals for perfoamcen vary, but potential objectives for smart blinds are:

- Minimize energy use due to lighting by allowing light into the room and reducing energy used for artificial lights
- Minmize cooling costs by blocking intense sunlight that would otherwise heat the room
- Respond to room occupancy.

Your task is to integrate the multiple in-room lighting sensors, the
controllable blinds, and an occupancy sensor, based on the control
objectives selected.
