# Smart Peloton

In cycling, a peloton is a group of bikes that self-organize into a
cluster to share the effort to overcome wind resistance. The lead bikes
bear the most effort while trailing bikes travel in the slipstream. 

Suppose each bike has a micro that can connect to the others. How can
we use these devices to manage fairness among leaders and followers?
