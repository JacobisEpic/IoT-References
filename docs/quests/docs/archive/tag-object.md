# ID Tag and Find Object

In this quest you will design a means to find missing objects such as
a TV remote or a set of keys. Or multiple items. 

This problem can be approached different ways. Assume each object has
an ESP32 with BLE and WiFi available. One could exploit anchors or
beacons to position the devices with ranging; or IR signals. You
design an approach based on sensors in the kit.
