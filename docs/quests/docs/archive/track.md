# Track Navigation Task

Your goal in this quest is to build on quest 5 to add turn and user
query-based track navigation. The track will incorporate elements from
the skill to achieve staying in lane parallel to the wall, stop for an
obstacle, then continue until a turn, and turn. We do not reveal
whether the turn will be to the left or to the right. Instead, this
must be queried to a user in real-time, based on skill 34 (below). The
user will specify the turn direction, and the car will then turn and
continue along a perpendicular wall until the finish line, as shown in
the figure below.  To accommodate this track navigation, we add skill
34 below. Note that there may be more than one obstacle and turns in
the actual track.

Competition Metrics: Collisions, route completion percent, time to destination, deviation from lane
center (see rubric regarding lanes dimensions).

## Investigative Question

If a user is not available to query, how could the system resolve turn direction in real-time?
