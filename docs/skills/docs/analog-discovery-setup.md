The Digilent Analog Discovery board is a multifunctional I/O board,
function generator, digital oscilloscope, and logic analyzer.  This
tool is available to help design and debug your embedded systems work
and can also be used as a power supply.

## To bring up the AD board:

1. Go to the analog discovery web site and download and install the OS-appropriate software for your system called “Waveforms”
2. Plug the AD board into a USB port on your laptop and figure out the pinout from the unit
3. Try the following functions
   - Generating a square wave at 1kHz used to drive an LED (use appropriate current limiting resistor please)
   - Plotting the waveform using the oscilloscope function as input
   - Plotting the frequency components of the square wave with the spectrum analyzer
   - Capture screenshots of each output
4. If doing this as a skill, summarize results in Report.md in the appropriate folder of your github account
