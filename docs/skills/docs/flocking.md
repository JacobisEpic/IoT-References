# Flocking

We're probably not going to get to this exercise. But... the concept
plays out in a "decentralized" system in which many devices interact
and behaviors emerge "(emergent behaviors").  This means fish
schooling or birds flocking. The interesting part is that the emergent
behavior is derived from the ***individual*** actions of particiating
units. Each device will rely on what it can sense on it's own and will
take action based on this information.

We can demonstrate this behavior with our cars, for example, by
applying a rule to keep a minimum separation.
