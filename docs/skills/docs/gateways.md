# Gateways

The typical IoT gateway "bridges" between disparate networks. For
example, bridging between Zigbee or Bluetooth and WiFi. Then the core
challenge is to reconcile different addressing schemes (e.g., IP
addresses found on the Internet (on the LAN) and addresses on the
other network (PAN--Personal Area Network).

We've been working exclusively with WiFi so far in the course. If we
fire up the BLE part, we may use the ESP as a bridge into a BLE
network. In this case we will flesh out this instance and do some
basic configuration to show how address are propagate to and from the
bridge to source and send data to the PAN.
