# Set up and Use GitHub Individually

Why are we using GitHub?

We will be using GitHub to distribute example source code and to
evaluate your work.  We expect each student to maintain GitHub
repositories for version control, collaboration, and storage of source
code generated throughout the course.  We will assess your code, your
collaboration, and your effort when we access your repositories.

In this exercise, you will setup GitHub, possibly for the first time,
and/or configure GitHub to meet the needs of the class as an individual
contributor. Later, we will deal with group assignments and collaboration.

## Assignment

1. Skip to (3) if you have an account already.
2. Get and setup a personal GitHub account and sign in at
[GitHub](https://github.com).
	- Please note that ***all*** students must have their own individual accounts. If you already have a GitHub account, you are
more than welcome to use that! But make sure we can tell it's your
account.
3. Please convert your account to a ***student account***. This allows you to have unlimited private repositories. Follow this link:
[GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) which requires a simple verification process.
4. Post your github user ID on Piazza so that we can retrieve it and add you to the EC444 GitHub Organization.
5. Install and configure git on your computer. Alternatively, install GitHub Desktop which includes git. In some cases git will also be installed with other
components (e.g., Apple XCode)
	- Many will find the git terminal interface to be a pain. The Github Deskop makes it point and click.
	- However, GitHub does provide native applications for Windows and Mac that make it easy to install and configure Git and GitHub correctly.
	- The simplest way to go is to install GitHub Desktop and configure from there
6. Create an individual repository on GitHub
   	- Navigate to the course [GitHub](https://github.com/BU-EC444).
	- Click on the green "New" button to create a new ***private*** repository in the template of `Lastname-Firstname` with your name. This will be your main repository for your individual assignments.
	- You want to now clone this repository onto your local machine (see the option to do this at the same time)
7. Edit the README.md file for the appropriate skill (Github skill) ***on your local machine***. Add a few words to change this file
   	- Demonstrate commiting this change, then pushing to GitHub
8. Add a screenshot of the process linked to the README.md file. Commit and push.

## Team Assignment (do this after we form teams)
1. Create a team repository on GitHub (only one person on your team does this)
   	- Navigate to the course [GitHub](https://github.com/BU-EC444).
  	- Click on the green "New" button to create a new **private** repository in the template of `TeamX-Lastname1-Lastname2-Lastname3` with your team info. This will be your main repository for your team assignments.
   	- You want to now clone this repository onto your local machine (see the option to do this at the same time)
   	- Go back to github and add your team members to your team repo
