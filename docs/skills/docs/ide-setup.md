# Setup Editors and IDEs

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are invaluable for managing
and editing code and sometimes debugging. But individuals will have
different preferences.  It is possible to work with your favorite
editor. I was never a fan of vi, but emacs still works for me. Atom is
more modern. Nano is convenient once your files are copied to a RPi
and you want to make small changes.

## Assignment

1. Install your favorite IDE and/or editor (see links below)
2. Establish a working directory in your IDE -- this will be the home for your
EC444 materials that you push and pull from GitHub (for skills and separately for quests)
3. Note that this working directory will need to be within the scope of the IDF files (the build tools need to know about this directory and where the IDF files are located)

You will be done when you:
- Have a folder where you will keep EC444 code and reports on your computer
- Have a way of editing code and reports
