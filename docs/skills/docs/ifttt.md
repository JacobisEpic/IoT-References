# IFTTT

IFTTT -- If This Then That is a web based service designed to create
simple conditional interactions among web serivces. For our needs, it
is a tool to interact with various IoT products that require IFTTT. We
don't really need abstracted conditionals (it is designed to simplify
programming) since we are writing our own code. BUT, the IoT devices
are designed to hook into IFTTT.

The smart plug we are using is very manufacturer-specific. We're just
going to deal with what it is.  In this skill you will create a 'Smart
Life' account and connect your plug to the account. The fig below
shows what is going on as the plug talks to the account and then to
IFTTT (for which you will also need an account).

## Assignment

1. Get the Smart Life account (links below) and app and demonstrate controlling the
plug with a light bulb or something similar.
2. Get the IFTTT account and link in a web app of your own. 
Ideally this is something from your own node.js server. Consider using a node.js package related to IFTTT
3. Create a simple link from a web page (via node.js) to IFTTT and subsequenlty the smart plug. 
4. Demonstrate and report.
