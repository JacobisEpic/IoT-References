# Mongo.db and Databases


We want you to set up a mongo database to log and retrieve data from a
collection of sensors in your system. This paradigm (not necessarily
mongo) is core to IoT systems. We will build off of node.js to make it
less (we hope) painful.

Here is what we want you to do:

## Assignment
1. Install mongo and any helerp apps to bring up node and mongo
2. Use a simple data structure to host sensor data (time, temperature)
3. Set up a single ESP to source data to your node server with data sourced at 1 s intervals
4. Record the data into your mongo db
5. Demonstrate a query to the database on (time, temperature)
6. Report
