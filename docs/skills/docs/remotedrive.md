# Remote Drive

Often, autonomous systems fail. It is important to be able to remotely
intervene in such cases, e.g., a scenario where an autonomous vehicle
doesn't know what to do (a construction zone, bad weather).  In this
skill, we are asking you to create an interface for remotely
controlling the speed and steering of the vehicle.

## Assignment:
- Build on the previous skill 'stop' and 'go' website functionalities in order to add a 
longitudinal controller (forward and slow down, backwards is possible but requires additional setup, this is not needed).  
- Also add a latitudinal controller (left and right steering).
- This can be implemented via buttons or via a mouse cursor interface, either way is OK, but some methods may be more intuitive and responsive. 
- Demonstrate capabilities of remotely operating the car from your laptop.
