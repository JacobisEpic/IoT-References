# Uploading Video to Cloud

Quests will require technical communications using video. In this
exercise you will setup the accounts and pathways to rapidly record
and post video that can be viewed by instructors.

## Content requirements

- Under no circumstances should you upload anything longer than 120 seconds – that’s cruel and unusual punishment. 
If you can get your point across in less than 120 seconds, make it so.
- 16x9 format please. Always in landscape or we will send it back
- Ideally use a tripod or selfie-stick with mount
- Video of whiteboard sketches is ok
- Video of code is not useful. Also cruel and unusual. You will lose points for this.
- Editing will improve your content but it is possible to shoot in one take. Your goal should be to effectively communicate your work. 
- There is a storyboard example linked to the utility section 

## Assignment

1. Decide how you want to store your recorded video (youtube, vimeo,
google drive etc.). The BU Google drive is effective as long as you
are logged in via your BU account. ***Do not
store video at GitHub -- not enough storage here.***  
2. Create the appropriate account and log in  
3. Remember to grant us access 
4. Set up an area (on, e.g., Google Drive) for your class video recordings 
5. Use your phone to record something
simple (a video selfie of your name, class year, and major) 
6. Upload your video to your cloud
storage selected in (1).  
7. Create README.md file in the github folder for this assignment that must include 
   	  - Assignment number and title 
	  - Your name 
	  - Content: link to video (note: we prefer embedded video instead of a link) 
8. Make sure you are satisfied with the appearance of the README.md 
9. Save the README.md in your local repo; commit and push to Github.
