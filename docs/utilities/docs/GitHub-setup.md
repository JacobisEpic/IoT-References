## GitHub

### Why are we using GitHub?

We will be using GitHub to distribute example source code to all of the teams, and we expect each student to maintain two GitHub repositories for collaboration and storage of source code generated throughout the course.

### What is Git? How is it different from GitHub?

If you're new to Git, we recommend you review [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKVlZ3wFVKA) on the difference between Git and GitHub.

## Setting up your GitHub Account

To contribute to GitHub repositories, you will need to set up a personal GitHub account. You can do this from [the GitHub home page](https://github.com/), using your BU email address (or other).

Please note that **all** students must have their own individual accounts. If you already have a GitHub account, you are more than welcome to use that! But make sure we can tell it's your account.

In addition, if you would like unlimited private repositories, it is worthwhile to convert your GitHub account to a [student account](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new), which requires a simple verification process though.

## Installing GitHub

### The easy way (GUI, Mac + Windows)

While Git and GitHub can be used without a GUI interface, GitHub provides native applications for Windows and Mac that make it easy to install and configure Git and GitHub correctly. They also provide tools that can be helpful when learning to incorporate Git into your software development workflow.

Please note that installing the GUI does not prevent you from using the command-line interface as you become more comfortable with Git.

Download and install the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/) and configure it to use your GitHub account.

### The less-easy way (command line, all platforms)

[GitHub has written great articles](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) on setting up and configuring Git using the command line interface. Select your operating system at the top of the article, and follow the instructions.

## Setting up your Repository

Everyone will be assigned two repositories to store, collaborate on, and submit code. We've created a template for you to base your repository on, which can be found [here](https://github.com/EC544-BU/EC544-Group).

Check out our [GitHub Project Workflow](https://github.com/EC544-BU/EC544_Arduino_sketches/wiki/Guide:-GitHub-Project-Workflow) page for information on how you should set up your team's GitHub repository.

## How will our repo be used in grading?

The instructors will use commits to the GitHub repository to determine how much each group member contributed to each challenge. For more information on this, please check out our [GitHub Grading Guide](https://github.com/EC544-BU/EC544_demos/wiki/Guide:-GitHub-Grading).

## How do I...?

Check out our [Common GitHub Procedures](https://github.com/EC544-BU/EC544_Arduino_sketches/wiki/Guide:-Common-GitHub-Procedures) guide for information on how to perform most common tasks with Git/GitHub.
