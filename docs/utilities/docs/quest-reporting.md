# Quest Reporting Guidelines

## Deliverables:

Deliverables include a team Github folder including code, README.md,
images, etc. for the quest. This repo must be in the EC444 context
(accessible by instructors) and accessible by each team member.

## Naming of the Repo:

**TeamX-Lastname1-Lastname2-Lastname3**

For example: **Team01-Price-Porcello-Sale**

## Report as README.md

The repo must include the README.md file containing your report
content including:

1. Quest Name
2. Authors
3. Date
4. Summary:
Summarize what the quest is about and what you had to do to get it to work
5. Solution Design:
Describe how you built your solution. Use hardware and software
diagrams, show data flow, include control flow or state charts if
appropriate.
6. Quest Summary:
Summarize your results and call out any challenges or things you would
have done differently.
7. Supporting Artifacts
- Link to video technical presentation. Not to exceed 120s
- Link to video demo. Not to exceed 120s
8. Self-Assessment 
9. AI and Open Source Code Assertions

## On the Video Content

The video recording(s) must be in landscape mode and not exceed 120s per part:
- Part 1: narration of the design solution describing the technical part
    - Each team member appears in video
    - We recommend: Introduction, overview, key technical details, summary.
    - A storyboard plan may be helpful to think about the flow but not mandatory [storyboard](/docs/untilties/docs/storyboard1.pptx)
- Part 2: demonstration of the implemented solution
  - Must show each of the required elements (objective criteria)
  - If it is not shown in the video, or is ambiguous, you will lose points

***Make sure to clearly show all rubric elements in the video!***
