#  Skill: 8x8 Dot-Array

Author: Rafael Devers

Date: 2024-09-01


### Summary

In this skill assignment, I wired a 8x8 LED Dot-Array to the ESP32
using shift registers. This allows me to use 3 GPIO pins on the
micro-controller to control 64 LEDs. In this example, I used the
dot-array display one line of the dot-array at a time to test out the
functionality.

### AI and Open Source Code Assertions

- I have documented in my code readme.md and in my code any
software that we have adopted from elsewhere
- I used AI for coding and this is documented in my code as
indicated by comments "AI generated"
