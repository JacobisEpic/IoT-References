# WiFi Channel Allocation
The WiFi 2.4 GHz spectrum is divided into 11 different channels, each 20 MHz wide. Only 3 of those channels do not overlap with each other. In an attempt to try to minimize congestion, we are assigning each team a channel to use. We ask that you please adhere to this channel assignment.
